      <h1>Welcome to The Mindful Market</h1>
      <h3>We are 4 friends who met while learning to program. Then we decided we want to use our newly developed skills to help create a better world.
      <br />
      <br />
       So welcome to The Mindful Market - a curated marketplace of socially conscious companies. We have selected only the best purpose-driven companies, focused on the environment, social justice, women empowerment, and other issues, and selected only their best products.
       <br />
      <br />
       Before you had to search for hours to find and then screen socially conscious companies. You would have to pay multiple shipping fees with random terms. No longer. We've brought all the best items under 1 roof. Well, metaphorically.
       <br />
      <br />
      So start shopping, and start making a difference.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Mindful Market - redefining shopping, for those who care.
