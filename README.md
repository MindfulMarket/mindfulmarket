# Mindful Market

Mindful market is an ecommerce platform for ther sale of eco-conscious, sustainable goods. Think of any other one-stop-shop website, but with a focus on products made by companies which support particular causes or efforts to do good. The site is not actually open for business (...yet) but rather was a group project completed by four of us (Bruce Leong, Micah Friedland, Danny McGillicuddy, Reese Long) while at Fullstack experience in order to further our skills with the stack we used, namely:

- React-redux, HTML and CSS on the front end
- Express, sequelize and postgreSQL on the backend
- Oauth for authentication with Google

We also used a variety of other tools such as github for version control and collaboration, travis for continuous integration, heroku for deployment, chai/mocha for testing and others (take a look at the package.json to see the modules we found useful)
